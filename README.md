I am one of the brightest brains to have emerged from the Federal University of Technology, Akure (FUTA). Nigeria most prestigious technical university. I have developed cost-effective geospatial approaches; that are highly suggested for Ondo State, Southwest Nigeria's coastal regions. The very susceptible areas of Awoye, Aiyetoro, Ajapa and Apata are clearly visible; in these areas, the established flood risk maps currently function as a vital source of activation energy for disaster preparedness and susceptibility mitigation in Ilaje. I have achieved a 98.31% flood risk prediction with a further indication of a 40% higher risk of inundation in crucial areas, benefiting Ilaje's local population of 289,838. These insights directly align with the UN Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Global Goal 13; the urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. Thus, in addition to prioritising Early-Warning Systems (EWS) in disaster forecasting as demonstrated through digitalization in other parts of the world, my combinations of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) model, Frequency Ratio (FR) and advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques, specifically Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) have yielded community-centric paradigms.

Currently, I am working on the 'CoastalGuard' project. Benefitting from the Microsoft 'grant' for Startups Founders Hub of over $2,500 credits, this is a Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems (MHEWS) enhancing coastal community resilience anywhere on Earth. By using advanced ML and real-time data, I aim to predict natural hazards like flooding, drought aand saline water intrusion in susceptible areas on Nigeria's coast including Lagos Islands (Isale Eko) and others. CoastalGuard thus, provide superior predictive accuracy and real-time alerts, empowering proactive mitigation through disaster preparedness in coastal communities, local governments, disaster management agencies and NGOs in my country.
