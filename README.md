ABOUT

My name is Al-Amin Saheed Babatunde. I am one of the brightest brains to have emerged from the Federal University of Technology, Akure (FUTA). Nigeria most prestigious technical university. As a fresh graduate of Applied Geology, I have developed cost-effective geospatial approaches; that are highly suggested for Ondo State, Southwest Nigeria's coastal regions. The very susceptible areas of Awoye, Aiyetoro, Ajapa and Apata are clearly visible; in these areas, the established flood risk maps currently function as a vital source of activation energy for disaster preparedness and susceptibility mitigation in Ilaje. I have achieved a 98.31% flood risk prediction with a further indication of a 40% higher risk of inundation in crucial areas, benefiting Ilaje's local population of 289,838. These insights directly align with the UN Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Global Goal 13; the urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. Thus, in addition to prioritising Early-Warning Systems (EWS) in disaster forecasting as demonstrated through digitalization in other parts of the world, my combinations of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) model, Frequency Ratio (FR) and advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques, specifically Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) have yielded community-centric paradigms.

Currently, I am working on the 'CoastalGuard' project. Benefitting from the Microsoft 'grant' for Startups Founders Hub of over $2,500 credits, this is a Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems (MHEWS) enhancing coastal community resilience anywhere on Earth. By using advanced ML and real-time data, I aim to predict natural hazards like flooding, drought aand saline water intrusion in susceptible areas on Nigeria's coast including Lagos Islands (Isale Eko) and others. CoastalGuard thus, provide superior predictive accuracy and real-time alerts, empowering proactive mitigation through disaster preparedness in coastal communities, local governments, disaster management agencies and NGOs in my country.

• ™GPM 500: A Solar-Powered Coastal Flood Risk Drone

Event: Nigeria International Energy Summit (NIES2024)

University Recognition: https://www.futa.edu.ng/home/newsd/947

i) Description 
I designed the GPM 500, a solar-powered drone engineered to monitor and assess flood risks in coastal regions. This innovation provided real-time data on rainfall, land use, and distance from water bodies, crucial for managing flood risks.

ii) Key Features
- Solar Power Integration: Ensured sustainable operations for extended flight durations in coastal environments.
- Advanced Sensors: Equipped with sensors to measure key flood risk parameters such as rainfall intensity, distance from rivers, and land-use patterns.
- Machine Learning Integration:Real-time data was fed into predictive models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for accurate flood risk assessments.

iii) Results
- Award-winning innovation at NIES2024, recognized for its contributions to climate adaptation and flood risk management in Nigeria’s coastal regions.


• Flood Vulnerability Mapping of Ilaje, Ondo State, Southwest, Nigeria Using Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence 

Institution: The Federal University of Technology, Akure (FUTA)

Supervisor: Dr. Oluwasanmi Owoseni Joshua (Ph.D.)

i) Description
My final year project focused on flood vulnerability assessment using advanced machine learning techniques. Applied multiple spatial analysis methods to generate a comprehensive flood risk map for the coastal region of Ilaje, Ondo State.
